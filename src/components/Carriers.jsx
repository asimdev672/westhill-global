          <p className="para">
            Industry data shows that when insurers miss the mark on how claims
            are handled, both customer satisfaction and retention suffer: -85
            points satisfaction on survey scores & 83% switch or plan to switch
            (JD Power 2021).

              Cash Settlement is not a world class customer experience
            </h3>

            <p className="para">
              According to J.D. Power, the 2nd highest negative factor cited in
              a claims experience is a "high level of effort to resolve".
              However, in a cash settlement model, consumers are asked to do
              just that after receiving their check.

            <p className="para">
              Offering services such as managed repair as an alternative to cash
              settlement models has demonstrated a significant increase in
              customer satisfaction, resulting in survey score increases between
              33-44 points.

            Continually creating a better policyholder experience is perhaps the
            most crucial factor in competing for customer satisfaction,
            retention, and growth. By offering a managed repair solution to
            policyholders, carriers can truly make a difference in their overall
            experience.

            Now more than ever, policyholders, and consumers in general, highly
